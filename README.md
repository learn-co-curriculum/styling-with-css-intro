# Making The Web Look Good With CSS

We've learned a bit about HTML. While HTML does a great job of putting words 
and pictures on the page, CSS exists to make your content _look good_.

Let's take a look at a rather simple example of what CSS does. Go ahead and 
flip between the HTML and CSS tabs of the CodePen below. You'll see the HTML 
sections has just a simple header: `<h1>This Is My Header</h1>`. The text turns 
up red though. How is that possible? The magic of CSS is how. Click on the CSS 
tab. You'll notice we set the color to red with this line: `color: red`. If you change 
the `red` to `green` what happens? It turns green! BOOM You just wrote your first 
CSS. Congrats!
